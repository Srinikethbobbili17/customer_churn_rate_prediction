# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

This project implements a deep learning model using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict **customer churn** based on historical behavior data. It helps telecom/retail/banking businesses proactively identify which customers are likely to leave.

## 🧠 Objective

The aim is to:
- Build a predictive model that classifies whether a customer will churn or not
- Use customer features like demographics, account activity, and engagement history
- Apply deep learning techniques for better generalization and performance
